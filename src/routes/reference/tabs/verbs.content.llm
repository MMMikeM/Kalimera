# Verbs Reference Content

Verb conjugation patterns and the system behind Greek verbs.

## Purpose

Explain the conjugation SYSTEM - learn 3 patterns, conjugate thousands of verbs. Verb vocabulary browsing is at /learn/verbs.

## Key Insight

Greek verb endings show who's doing the action, so you often don't need separate pronouns. Learn three patterns and conjugate thousands of verbs.

## Voice: Who Does the Action?

<section name="voice-explanation">
<title>Greek verbs show not just WHO (the endings) but also the DIRECTION of action</title>

### Active: Subject DOES the action
- βλέπω τον φίλο = I see the friend
- Action flows FROM me TO the friend

### Passive: Subject RECEIVES the action
- βλέπομαι από τον φίλο = I am seen by the friend
- Action flows TO me FROM the friend

### The -μαι Marker
The -μαι ending is the passive marker:
- βλέπω (I see) → βλέπομαι (I am seen)
- ακούω (I hear) → ακούομαι (I am heard)

### Deponent: Passive form, active meaning
Some verbs ONLY exist in -μαι form, but their meaning is active:
- έρχομαι = I come (not "I am come-d")
- θυμάμαι = I remember (not "I am remembered")
- κοιμάμαι = I sleep (not "I am slept")

<etymology>
Why "deponent"? From Latin deponere (to put aside) - these verbs have "set aside" their active forms.
</etymology>
