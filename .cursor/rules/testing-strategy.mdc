# Testing Strategy

This project prioritizes logic and data layer testing over UI testing.

- **Focus on**: Unit and integration tests for business logic, data access, and API endpoints.
- **Avoid**: End-to-end UI tests that simulate user interaction with the browser. Components should be tested based on their props and state, not their rendered output.
- **Tools**: Use `vitest` for running tests.
