# File Structure & Component Organization

## Project Architecture

Based on [rewrite.plan.md](mdc:rewrite.plan.md) - a user-workflow-centric component architecture.

## Required Directory Structure

### Core Components (`src/components/`)

```
src/components/
├── QuickReference.tsx           # Main dashboard for quick lookups
│   └── reference/
│       ├── ArticlesAndCases.tsx # Static component for article/case rules
│       ├── PronounGuide.tsx     # Static component for personal pronouns
│       └── VerbPatterns.tsx     # Static component for verb conjugation patterns
│
├── CategoryVocabulary.tsx       # Main component for studying vocabulary by category
│
├── TargetedPractice.tsx         # Dashboard for choosing practice modes
│
├── WordInbox.tsx                # Quick-add component for new words
└── WordProcessor.tsx            # Form to enrich and process words from the inbox
```

### Database Structure (`src/db/`)

```
src/db/
├── index.ts                   # Database & Kysely initialization
├── schema.ts                  # TypeScript database schema
└── migrations/                # Kysely migration files for schema changes
```

### Data-Related Scripts (`src/scripts/`)

```
src/scripts/
└── seed.ts                    # Unified script for seeding initial data
```

## Component & File Organization Rules

1. **Feature-based components** are the primary organizational unit.
2. **Static reference components** are grouped under a `reference/` directory.
3. **Database operations** should be handled within server-side logic or dedicated scripts, not directly in UI components.
4. **Initial data seeding** is managed by a single, clear script.
