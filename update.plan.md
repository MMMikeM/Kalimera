   - Include contextual memory aids
   - Create association patterns

4. **Progressive Learning Flow** - Create logical progression from basics to advanced
   - Essential daily patterns first
   - Common use cases second  
   - Complex/academic uses last

### **Phase 3: Interactive Enhancement** ⭐ FUTURE
5. **Interactive Elements** - Hover examples and contextual hints
6. **Advanced Examples** - Complex sentence patterns and edge cases

### **Current Success Metrics:**

   - Complex possessive chains
   - Formal register patterns

### **2. Enhanced Recognition Patterns**

**Add These Visual Cues:**
- 🔍 **Quick Spot Patterns**: -ν endings, article changes
- 🎯 **Context Clues**: Action words → accusative, "of/whose" → genitive
- 📝 **Common Mistakes**: Side-by-side corrections

### **3. Memory Device Expansion**

**Strengthen WHO/WHAT/WHERE/WHOSE with:**
