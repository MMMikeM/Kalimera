# Greek Learning Progression

A pedagogically-ordered sequence for learning Modern Greek grammar, designed around cognitive load management, communicative utility, and research-backed interleaving.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Prerequisites first** - Don't introduce a concept until its dependencies are understood
2. **High-frequency first** - Prioritize words/patterns learners will encounter immediately
3. **Communicative utility** - Learners should form complete sentences at every stage
4. **Interleaving** - Mix nominal and verbal grammar rather than completing one before starting the other
5. **Progressive disclosure** - Core concept visible, details collapsible
6. **2-4 new forms per session** - Respect working memory limits

## Research Foundation

See `/docs/learning-theory.md` for full citations. Key findings:

- **Interleaving beats blocking** (Serfaty & Serrano 2022): Mixing grammar topics improves transfer and retention
- **Early verbs are essential**: Research recommends είμαι within week 1, action verbs by weeks 3-4
- **Paradigm tables overload**: Working memory processes only 2-4 elements simultaneously (Sweller)
- **Explicit instruction works for adults** (Norris & Ortega 2000): But must be integrated with meaningful practice

## The Progression

### Phase 1: Framework + First Sentences

#### 1. Cases (Conceptual)

**The framework that explains why words change.**

| Case       | Question     | Example                 |
|------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Nominative | WHO does it? | **Ο Γιάννης** τρώει     |
| Accusative | WHAT/WHOM?   | Βλέπω **τον Γιάννη**    |
| Genitive   | WHOSE?       | Το σπίτι **του Γιάννη** |

**Why first:** Cases are the organizing principle. Present them as a meaning-making system (what they *do*), not paradigm tables to memorize.

**Key insight:** Greek uses word endings where English uses word order.

**Scope:** Conceptual understanding only. Full paradigms come later.

---

#### 2. Articles (Nominative + Accusative)

**Gender and case signals—but only the forms you need now.**

|     | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|-----|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nom | ο         | η        | το     |
| Acc | τον       | την      | το     |

**Why second:** Articles signal gender and case. Learners need nominative for subjects and accusative for objects before they can form sentences.

**Key insight:** The article tells you what's coming. Watch ο→τον and you know a direct object follows.

**Scope:** Nominative and accusative singular only. Genitive and plurals wait.

---

#### 3. είμαι + θέλω (First Verbs)

**First complete sentences: "I am", "I want".**

| Person | είμαι (to be) | θέλω (to want) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| εγώ    | είμαι         | θέλω           |
| εσύ    | είσαι         | θέλεις         |
| αυτός  | είναι         | θέλει          |

**Why third:** These two verbs unlock real communication immediately:

- Είμαι καλά (I'm fine)
- Είμαι στο σπίτι (I'm at home)
- Θέλω καφέ (I want coffee)
- Θέλεις νερό; (Do you want water?)

**Key insight:** Greek verb endings show WHO is acting—you often don't need separate pronouns.

**What learner can now say:** Complete sentences with subjects and objects.

---

### Phase 2: Building Blocks

#### 4. Subject Pronouns

**Why Greek drops them—and when you need them.**

| Person | Pronoun        | When to use                    |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| 1st    | εγώ (I)        | Emphasis: "I did it, not you"  |
| 2nd    | εσύ (you)      | Contrast: "What about you?"    |
| 3rd    | αυτός/ή/ό      | Clarity when subject is ambiguous |

**Why here:** Now that learners know verb endings show person, they can understand why subject pronouns are optional—and when to use them for emphasis.

**Key insight:** If the verb ending is clear, dropping the pronoun sounds more natural.

---

#### 5. Basic Nouns (Nominative/Accusative)

**High-frequency nouns in the cases you already know.**

Example: ο φίλος (the friend, masculine)

| Case | Form         | Example sentence              |
|------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Nom  | ο φίλ**ος**  | Ο φίλος είναι εδώ (The friend is here) |
| Acc  | τον φίλ**ο** | Θέλω τον φίλο (I want the friend)      |

**Why here:** Learners already understand cases conceptually and know nominative/accusative articles. Now they see noun endings follow the same pattern.

**Key insight:** Masculine accusative drops the -ς (φίλος → φίλο). This echoes the article (ο → τον adds -ν, noun drops -ς).

**Scope:** Nominative and accusative only. High-frequency nouns. Genitive waits.

---

#### 6. Object Pronouns

**Who receives the action.**

|       | Singular  | Plural      |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1st   | με (me)   | μας (us)    |
| 2nd   | σε (you)  | σας (you)   |
| 3rd m | τον (him) | τους (them) |
| 3rd f | την (her) | τις (them)  |
| 3rd n | το (it)   | τα (them)   |

**Why here:** Learners can now say "I want it", "He sees me", "Do you want them?"

**Key insight:** Object pronouns come *before* the verb in Greek: **Τον** θέλω (I want him), not *Θέλω τον.

**What learner can now say:** "Με βλέπεις;" (Do you see me?), "Το θέλω" (I want it)

---

### Phase 3: Expanding Expression

#### 7. More Verbs (Present Tense)

**Action verbs for everyday communication.**

| Verb    | Meaning    | εγώ    | εσύ     | αυτός   |
|---------|------------|--------|---------|---------|
| έχω     | to have    | έχω    | έχεις   | έχει    |
| κάνω    | to do/make | κάνω   | κάνεις  | κάνει   |
| πάω     | to go      | πάω    | πας     | πάει    |
| μιλάω   | to speak   | μιλάω  | μιλάς   | μιλάει  |

**Why here:** With nouns and pronouns established, learners can now build varied sentences.

**Key insight:** Most -ω verbs follow the same pattern. Learn one, predict many.

**Scope:** Present tense, 1st/2nd/3rd person singular. Full paradigms (plurals, other tenses) wait.

---

#### 8. Adjectives

**Agreement with nouns: gender, case, and number.**

Adjectives must match the noun in gender and case.

|        | Masculine | Feminine  | Neuter    |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Nom sg | καλ**ός** | καλ**ή**  | καλ**ό**  |
| Acc sg | καλ**ό**  | καλ**ή**  | καλ**ό**  |

**Why here:** Prerequisites met—learners understand cases, recognize gender from articles, and know noun patterns. Adjectives are a natural extension.

**Key insight:** Adjectives copy the noun. Look at the article, match its gender and case.

**Examples:**

- ο καλ**ός** φίλ**ος** (the good friend) — masculine nominative
- τον καλ**ό** φίλ**ο** (the good friend) — masculine accusative
- θέλω **ζεστό** καφέ (I want hot coffee) — neuter accusative

**What learner can now say:** "Ο καλός φίλος είναι εδώ" (The good friend is here)

---

#### 9. Prepositions

**Location, direction, purpose—all take accusative.**

| Preposition | Meaning   | Example                     |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| σε          | to/at/in  | Πάω **στο** σπίτι (I go home) |
| από         | from      | Είμαι **από** την Αθήνα     |
| για         | for/about | Είναι **για** σένα          |
| με          | with      | Έρχομαι **με** τον φίλο     |

**Why here:** Prepositions require knowing accusative forms. The σε contractions (στον, στην, στο) build on article knowledge.

**Key insight:** All prepositions take accusative. No exceptions. This simplifies things.

---

### Phase 4: Completing the System

#### 10. Genitive Case

**Possession and the "of" relationship.**

|     | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|-----|-----------|----------|--------|
| Gen | του       | της      | του    |

Possessive pronouns: μου (my), σου (your), του/της/του (his/her/its)

**Why here:** Genitive is less frequent than nominative/accusative. Introducing it now lets learners say "my house", "John's car".

**Key insight:** Possessives come *after* the noun: το σπίτι **μου** (my house), not *μου σπίτι.

---

#### 11. Full Verb Paradigms

**Third person and plurals.**

| Person | Singular | Plural    |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| 1st    | μιλ**άω**  | μιλ**άμε** |
| 2nd    | μιλ**άς**  | μιλ**άτε** |
| 3rd    | μιλ**άει** | μιλ**άνε** |

**Why here:** Learners have been using 1st/2nd/3rd singular. Now complete the picture.

**Key insight:** The pattern is consistent. Once you know one -άω verb, you know them all.

---

#### 12. Noun Declension Patterns

**Expanding beyond high-frequency forms.**

Now introduce:

- Full case paradigms (including vocative)
- Different noun patterns (-ος, -ας, -ης masculine; -α, -η feminine; -ο, -ι neuter)
- Plural forms

**Why here:** Learners have internalized the case system through high-frequency forms. Now they can see the full picture without overwhelm.

---

### Phase 5: Refinement

#### 13. Vocative Case

**Direct address—lower priority.**

| Nominative | Vocative   | Usage           |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| Γιάννης    | Γιάννη!    | Hey John!       |
| φίλος      | φίλε!      | Friend! (calling)|

**Why last among cases:** In casual speech, nominative is rarely wrong for address. Vocative is polish, not necessity.

---

#### 14. The -ν Rules

**When to add -ν to articles and pronouns.**

Add -ν before:

- Vowels: τη**ν** Αθήνα
- κ, π, τ: το**ν** καφέ
- ξ, ψ: τη**ν** ψυχή

**Why late:** These are refinements for natural-sounding Greek. Omitting -ν is understood; getting it wrong doesn't block communication.

---

#### 15. Formal Register

**Εσείς for politeness.**

Use εσείς (you-plural) for:

- Strangers
- Older people
- Professional contexts

**Why last:** Learners can communicate fine with informal forms. Formal register is social polish.

## Why This Order Works

| Phase | What's New | What Learner Can Now Say |
|-------|-----------|-------------------------|
| 1.3 | είμαι, θέλω | "I am fine", "I want coffee" |
| 2.6 | Object pronouns | "He sees me", "I want it" |
| 3.7 | More verbs | "I have a car", "I speak Greek" |
| 3.8 | Adjectives | "The good friend", "hot coffee" |
| 3.9 | Prepositions | "I go to the house", "from Athens" |
| 4.10 | Genitive | "my house", "John's car" |

**The key difference from traditional progressions:** Learners form complete sentences at every stage. They don't accumulate six stages of nominal grammar before saying their first verb.

## Pedagogical Notes

### Why Verbs Can't Wait

The original progression placed verbs at position 8. This violated both research and common sense:

1. **Communicative utility:** Six stages of grammar without "I want" or "I see" is demotivating
2. **Orthogonal systems:** Declension (nouns) and conjugation (verbs) don't compete for the same mental slots—they can be learned in parallel
3. **Interleaving research:** Mixing categories aids retention (Serfaty & Serrano 2022)

### Why Cases Stay First (Conceptually)

Cases are still introduced first—but as a *conceptual framework*, not paradigm tables. The learner needs to understand that word endings signal meaning before seeing specific forms.

### Adjectives: The Placement Decision

Adjectives appear at position 8 (Phase 3) based on prerequisites:

1. **Cases** → understand WHY words change
2. **Articles** → recognize gender signals
3. **Nouns** → see declension patterns
4. **Adjectives** → apply the same patterns to modifiers

Not earlier: "agreement" is meaningless without the foundation.
Not later: adjectives are high-frequency and enable descriptive language.

### Error Correction: Woven In, Not Siloed

The original progression had "Common Mistakes" as stage 7. Research on "Focus on Form" (Long) suggests error correction works better integrated into each topic rather than isolated. Each section should include common mistakes for that concept.
