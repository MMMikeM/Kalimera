Yes, absolutely! Your intuition is spot on. There is a very natural and highly effective way to split ("Articles & Basics").

The split is between **the abstract rules** and **the practical application**.

By separating them, you create a clearer learning path: one page is your "Grammar Rulebook," and the other is your "Real-World Phrasebook." This is an excellent pedagogical approach.

Here is how you could split it:

---

### New Page 1: The Core Rules (`The Greek Article & Case System`)

**Purpose:** This page is the definitive, clean reference sheet. It's where a learner goes when they need to look up a specific rule quickly. It's the "Why."

**Content for this page:**

1.  **"Quick Case Rules - Master These First!"** (Your `WHO does it?` / `WHAT/WHERE to?` / `WHOSE is it?` section. It's the perfect introduction.)
2.  **"The 'Tin Tis Toun' Mystery Solved!"** (The introductory paragraph explaining the concept.)
3.  **The Main Article Tables (Singular & Plural)**
    *   This is the centerpiece of the page.
    *   As suggested before, consider ordering the rows as Nominative, Accusative, Genitive for a more standard flow.
4.  **A NEW "Essential Formulas" Section:** This is the perfect place to put the other core rules that learners need.
    *   **Prepositional Contractions:**
        *   `σε + το = στο`
        *   `σε + τη(ν) = στη(ν)`
        *   `σε + τον = στον`
    *   **The "Movable Nu" (Final 'ν') Rule:**
        *   A small box explaining: "Tip: The -ν on `τον` and `την` is used before vowels and the consonants κ, π, τ, ξ, ψ."

**Why this works:** This page becomes a lean, powerful, and uncluttered reference tool. No examples, just the pure grammar system.

### New Page 2: Essential Daily Patterns (`Putting Grammar into Practice`)

**Purpose:** This page is all about seeing the grammar in action. It's for building vocabulary and memorizing high-frequency chunks of language. It's the "How."

**Content for this page:**

1.  **The "Priority #1 - 80% Daily Use" Banner.** (This banner belongs here, as this page is all about practical use.)
2.  **All Your Thematic Example Boxes:**
    *   `Coffee & Food` (τον καφέ, το ψωμί, τη μητέρα*, etc.)
    *   `House & Location` (πηγαίνω στο σπίτι)
    *   `Time & Schedule` (το πρωί, τη νύχτα)
    *   `Family & Relationships` (η μητέρα της Μαρίας)

**How to enhance this page even further:**

*   Make the key articles **clickable**. For example, a user sees `τον καφέ` and is confused by `τον`. They can click on `τον`, and it takes them directly to "New Page 1" (The Core Rules) for the explanation. This creates a fantastic, interactive learning loop.
*   You could eventually **expand this page with more themes** (like the ones from your first design: "Sports & Hobbies," "Travel & Transport") without cluttering the core grammar page.

### The New User Journey:

1.  A beginner starts on **Page 2 ("Essential Patterns")**. They learn to say "the coffee" is `τον καφέ`.
2.  They wonder, *"Why 'τον'?"*
3.  They click on `τον` or navigate to **Page 1 ("The Core Rules")**.
4.  They see the table and have an "aha!" moment: "Oh, it's the masculine direct object form!"
5.  They go back to **Page 2** to see more examples and practice.

This split perfectly separates **Reference** from **Practice**, which reduces cognitive load and makes the information much more digestible. You were right to feel there was a natural seam there.
