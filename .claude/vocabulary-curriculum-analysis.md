# Vocabulary Section Curriculum Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Vocabulary section demonstrates solid organizational principles with thematic groupings and pattern-based verb categorization. However, there are significant pedagogical gaps including missing high-frequency vocabulary, inconsistent gender display, and limited connection to grammar concepts taught elsewhere. The section could better serve learners by prioritizing frequency-based vocabulary selection, revealing grammatical patterns (especially noun gender/declension), and providing more contextual usage examples.

---

## Tab 1: Nouns

### Current State

The Nouns tab organizes vocabulary into 5 semantic categories:
- Family & People (21 items)
- Shopping & Groceries (9 items)
- Household & Home (7 items)
- Transportation (5 items)
- Summer & Beach (10 items)

### Strengths

1. **Greek First Principle** - Greek prominently displayed with articles, English as supporting context
2. **Gender Indicated by Article** - Using "o/n/to" articles effectively signals gender
3. **Semantic Grouping** - Categories make practical sense for conversational use
4. **Highlighted Styling** - Family & People section uses "highlighted" variant appropriately

### Pedagogical Issues

1. **Missing High-Frequency Core Vocabulary**
   - No body parts (hand, head, eye, water)
   - No food basics beyond shopping items (bread, water, coffee, wine)
   - No places/locations (city, country, school, restaurant)
   - No abstract essentials (thing, time, day, year, problem)

2. **Inconsistent Category Logic**
   - "Family & People" mixes family (mother, father) with professions (doctor, farmer, shepherd)
   - "shepherd", "dwarf", "hunter" are very low-frequency for beginners
   - Car appears in both "Household" (to autokinhto) and should logically be in "Transportation"

3. **Missing Declension Pattern Information**
   - No indication of noun class/declension pattern
   - A learner sees "o pateras" but doesn't know it declines differently from "o filos"
   - Missed opportunity: nouns could be grouped by declension pattern, not just meaning

4. **Gender-Based Grouping Absent**
   - No way to study "all feminine nouns" or "all neuter -i nouns"
   - Pattern-based learning is mentioned in app tagline but not applied here

5. **Missing Plurals**
   - No plural forms shown
   - Critical gap: learner can't form "ta paidia" from "to paidi"

### Specific Content Issues

| Issue | Example | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Low-frequency vocabulary | "nanos" (dwarf), "voskos" (shepherd) | Replace with "giagiu/pappus" (grandparents) |
| Duplicate concept | Car in Household section | Move to Transportation only |
| Missing essentials | No "naro" (water), "kafi" (coffee) | Add food/drink basics |
| Profession vs Family mix | "giatros" (doctor) in Family section | Create separate "Professions" section |

### Recommendations

1. **Reorganize "Family & People"** into two sections:
   - Family (immediate and extended family)
   - Occupations/Professions

2. **Add Missing Core Categories:**
   - Body Parts (soma, kefali, xeri, mati, podi)
   - Food & Drink (nero, kafe, krasi, tyri, kreas)
   - Places (poli, xora, scholio, estiatorio, nosokomeio)

3. **Consider Declension-Based Grouping:**
   - Masculine -os nouns (filos, giatros, dromos)
   - Masculine -as nouns (pateras, andras)
   - Feminine -a nouns (ginaika, mera, ora)
   - Neuter -o nouns (spiti, aftokinito)
   - Neuter -i nouns (paidi, kleidi)

4. **Show Plural Forms** for high-frequency nouns at minimum

---

## Tab 2: Verbs

### Current State

Verbs are organized by conjugation pattern:
- -o verbs (40+ verbs) - Regular type
- -ao/-o verbs (4 verbs) - Contract verbs
- -omai verbs (9 verbs) - Deponent/passive
- -amai verbs (4 verbs)
- Irregular (4 verbs)
- Transport Actions (5 verbs - special section)

### Strengths

1. **Pattern-Based Organization** - Excellent pedagogical approach
2. **Explanatory Alert** - "Learn one pattern and you can conjugate all verbs in that group"
3. **Verb Count Shown** - "40 verbs" helps learner understand scope
4. **Visual Differentiation** - Different color schemes for different patterns

### Pedagogical Issues

1. **No Conjugation Examples Shown**
   - Learner sees "kano = I do/make" but not the full paradigm
   - Missing: kano, kaneis, kanei, kanoume, kanete, kanoun

2. **Imbalanced Pattern Representation**
   - 40+ verbs in -o category vs 4 in -ao/-o
   - Learner might think -ao/-o is rare (it's actually very common)

3. **Missing Key High-Frequency Verbs**
   - No "pino" (I drink)
   - No "troo" (I eat) - appears only in Irregular section
   - No "grafo" (I write)
   - No "diaavazo" (I read)

4. **Transport Actions Section Confusion**
   - Contains "xekinaei" (departs) - 3rd person, not infinitive
   - Mixes with "pairno" (I take) - 1st person
   - Pedagogically inconsistent

5. **Missing Tense Indication**
   - All verbs are present tense
   - No indication of aspect (perfective/imperfective) which is crucial in Greek

6. **No Link to Verb Reference Page**
   - Quick Reference has detailed verb conjugation tables
   - Vocabulary verbs don't cross-reference

### Specific Content Issues

| Issue | Example | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Inconsistent person | "xekinaei" (3rd) vs "pairno" (1st) | Standardize to 1st person |
| Missing common verbs | No "pino", "grafo" | Add top 20 frequency verbs |
| No conjugation | Just "milaw = I speak" | Show sample conjugation |
| No aspect info | Present only | Add past tense column |

### Recommendations

1. **Show Sample Conjugation** - At least ego/esy/aftos forms for each pattern

2. **Add Missing High-Frequency Verbs:**
   - pino (drink), grafo (write), diaavazo (read)
   - xero (know), katalavaino (understand)
   - xtypao (hit/call), akouo (hear)

3. **Standardize Form** - All verbs in 1st person singular

4. **Cross-Reference Grammar** - Link to Quick Reference verb section

5. **Consider Adding Past Tense** - Even just one column showing the aorist stem

---

## Tab 3: Phrases

### Current State

Extensive phrase collection organized by function:
- Connectors & Fillers (7 phrases)
- Social Phrases (5 phrases)
- Commands (5 phrases)
- Question Words (6 words)
- Likes Construction (paradigm with singular/plural)
- Name Construction (paradigm)
- Telling Time (structured with Basic/Fractions/At Times)
- Discourse Markers (10 phrases)
- Common Responses (9 phrases)
- Expressing Opinions (9 phrases)
- Arriving & Leaving (8 phrases)
- Food & Hospitality (7 phrases)
- Small Talk (6 phrases)

### Strengths

1. **Paradigm Cards** - Likes and Name constructions show the full pattern excellently
2. **Category Alerts** - Pattern explanations (e.g., "the thing liked is the subject!")
3. **Time-Telling Structure** - Grouped by basic/fractions/at-times with notes
4. **Real Examples** - "mou aresi o kafes" not just "mou aresi = I like"
5. **Situational Grouping** - Arriving/Leaving, Food/Hospitality are practical

### Pedagogical Issues

1. **Overlap Between Categories**
   - "Discourse Fillers" vs "Discourse Markers" - subtle distinction lost on beginners
   - Some items could be in multiple categories

2. **Missing Essential Phrases**
   - No "Signomi" (Sorry/Excuse me) - wait, it's in Common Responses as "me sigxoreis"
   - No "Parakal" (Please/You're welcome)
   - No "Efxaristo" (Thank you)
   - These are THE most important phrases for a beginner

3. **Question Words Incomplete**
   - Missing "potE" (when) - vs "potE" (never) which is in adverbs
   - Missing "poso" (how many) vs "poso" (how much)

4. **Likes Construction Could Show Pattern Better**
   ```
   Current: Lists 7 singular examples, 7 plural examples
   Better: Show person progression:
     mou aresi/aresoun
     sou aresi/aresoun
     tou aresi/aresoun
     ...
   ```

5. **Name Construction Missing Questions**
   - Has "me lene" (my name is)
   - Missing "pos se lene?" (what's your name?)

6. **Time Section Gaps**
   - No ordinal numbers for dates (proti, defteri, etc.)
   - No days of week, months

### Specific Content Issues

| Issue | Example | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Missing basics | No "Efxaristo", "Parakalo" | Add in Social Phrases |
| Category overlap | Discourse Fillers vs Markers | Merge into one section |
| Incomplete paradigm | Name construction | Add "pos se lene?" question |
| Missing time vocab | No days/months | Add separate section |

### Recommendations

1. **Add Essential Phrases Section** at the top:
   - Efxaristo (thank you)
   - Parakalo (please/you're welcome)
   - Signomi (sorry)
   - Nai/Oxi (yes/no)

2. **Merge Discourse Categories** - "Connectors & Fillers" + "Discourse Markers" into one

3. **Complete Question Words:**
   - Add "pote" (when) with note about accent vs "pote" (never)
   - Add "posos/posi/posa" (how many)

4. **Add Temporal Vocabulary:**
   - Days of week (Defteria, Triti, etc.)
   - Months (Ianouarios, Fevruarios, etc.)
   - Date expressions (tin Defteria, ton Aprilio)

5. **Restructure Likes Construction** to show person progression in table format

---

## Tab 4: Reference

### Current State

Reference material organized as:
- Times of Day (5 items with time ranges)
- Numbers (0-100 with units/teens/tens grouping)
- Colors (8 colors)
- Adverbs of Frequency (12 items)
- Position & Direction (15 items)

### Strengths

1. **Times of Day Visual Treatment** - Cards with time ranges are clear
2. **Numbers Pattern Explanation** - "combine tens + units" rule explained
3. **Frequency Adverb Warning** - "pote = never, pote = when" accent distinction
4. **Position Adverbs Contextual Tip** - "Essential for giving directions"

### Pedagogical Issues

1. **Numbers Missing Key Information**
   - No gendered forms (enas/mia/ena for 1, tris/tria for 3)
   - No ordinal numbers (protos, defteros, tritos)
   - No higher numbers (500, 1000, 1000000)

2. **Colors Missing Gender**
   - Colors in Greek have gender agreement
   - "kokkino" shown but not "kokkini/kokkinos/kokkino"
   - Learner can't say "the red car" vs "the red house" correctly

3. **Missing Reference Categories**
   - Days of week (should be here, not in Phrases)
   - Months of year
   - Weather vocabulary
   - Ordinal numbers

4. **Frequency Adverbs Ordering**
   - Currently: seemingly random order
   - Should: ordered by frequency (never -> rarely -> sometimes -> often -> always)

5. **Position Adverbs Could Show Pairs**
   - mesa/exo (in/out), pano/kato (up/down), brosta/piso (front/back)
   - Pairing helps memory

### Specific Content Issues

| Issue | Example | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| No gendered numbers | Just "tria" (3) | Show tris/tria (m/n) |
| No ordinals | No protos, defteros | Add ordinal column |
| Colors ungended | Just "kokkino" | Show all 3 genders |
| Missing time units | No days/months | Add calendar section |

### Recommendations

1. **Add Ordinal Numbers** - At least 1st through 10th, plus "last" (teleftaios)

2. **Show Gender Variants for Numbers 1-4:**
   - enas/mia/ena
   - dyo (invariable)
   - tris/tris/tria
   - tesseris/tesseris/tessera

3. **Show Color Agreement:**
   - kokkinos/kokkini/kokkino (m/f/n)
   - Or at minimum show neuter form + note about agreement

4. **Add Calendar Vocabulary:**
   - Days of week with gender (i Deftera, i Triti...)
   - Months with gender (o Ianouarios, o Fevruarios...)

5. **Reorder Frequency Adverbs** on a spectrum from never to always

6. **Pair Position Adverbs** visually to show antonym relationships

---

## Cross-Section Issues

### 1. Grammar Connection Gap

The vocabulary section operates mostly independently from the grammar reference. Opportunities for integration:

| Vocabulary | Grammar Link | Suggestion |
|------------|--------------|------------|
| Nouns with articles | Case/Gender tables | Link to declension paradigms |
| Verbs by pattern | Conjugation tables | Show "see full conjugation" |
| Numbers 1-4 | Agreement section | Link to gender agreement |
| Likes construction | Pronoun reference | Link to weak pronoun forms |

### 2. Frequency Prioritization

Current vocabulary seems sourced from lesson transcripts rather than frequency lists. Consider:

1. **Add frequency tags** to vocabulary items
2. **Surface high-frequency items** prominently
3. **Mark low-frequency items** as "advanced" or "literary"

### 3. Missing Vocabulary Categories

| Category | Priority | Reasoning |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Body parts | High | Universal, daily use |
| Food/drink basics | High | Immediate practical need |
| Weather | Medium | Daily conversation topic |
| Emotions | Medium | Express feelings |
| Days/months | High | Scheduling, dates |
| Places (store, bank) | Medium | Navigation needs |

### 4. Example Sentences Underutilized

The seed data contains `EXAMPLE_SENTENCES` with grammar annotations, but these don't appear in the UI. These could:
- Appear as "usage examples" under vocabulary items
- Show vocabulary in grammatical context
- Demonstrate case usage with nouns

---

## Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Immediate Impact)

1. **Add essential phrases** - Efxaristo, Parakalo, Signomi at top of Phrases tab
2. **Add days/months** - Either in Reference tab or new Phrases section
3. **Show noun plurals** - At least for high-frequency nouns in Nouns tab
4. **Add gendered numbers** - Show enas/mia/ena variants in Reference tab

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Learning)

5. **Reorganize Family & People** - Separate family from professions
6. **Add core vocabulary** - Body parts, food/drink, places
7. **Show color agreement** - Gender forms for colors
8. **Add verb conjugation samples** - At least 3 persons shown

### Lower Priority (Polish)

9. **Merge discourse marker categories**
10. **Reorder frequency adverbs**
11. **Add ordinal numbers**
12. **Cross-link to grammar reference**

## Appendix: Seed Data Alignment

### Files Reviewed

| File | Content | UI Location |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `nouns.ts` | 10 categories of nouns | Nouns tab (5 categories shown) |
| `verbs.ts` | 41 verbs + transport phrases | Verbs tab |
| `phrases.ts` | Expressions, constructions, time | Phrases tab |
| `conversations.ts` | Discourse markers, responses | Phrases tab |
| `numbers.ts` | 0-100 | Reference tab |
| `adverbs.ts` | Frequency + Position | Reference tab |
| `adjectives.ts` | Colors + general adjectives | Reference tab (colors only) |

### Unused Seed Data

- `ADJECTIVES` array in `adjectives.ts` - Not displayed in UI
- `EXAMPLE_SENTENCES` in `phrases.ts` - Not displayed
- Several noun categories in `nouns.ts` not shown (nature, animals, places, abstract)

### Potential Duplication

- `timeExpressions` in nouns.ts overlaps with `timeOfDay` - some entries duplicated
- `USEFUL_EXPRESSIONS` is just a concat of fillers + social phrases (legacy)
